# Platforms For Platinum
![make plat get plat](httpshttp://i.imgur.com/YVdPPNa.png)

Buy Iron Chunks for cheap from the CX and convert them to Metal Platforms automatically. Fully automated with Carbine's addon API.

Use /plat to bring up the menu. Be near a crafting station before pressing Start.

## Known Issues
* Occasionally makes Metal Planks. Will make it more robust in the future...maybe
* If you fuck it up somehow you will get "Bad data" errors when trying to craft. Relog to fix since I don't know why it happens yet.
